# CRUD NODE APP

Node, MongoDb and Bootstrap

This page was created using Node, Express and several other modules: Express Handlebars such as templates, bcryptjs to encrypt user passwords, flash-connect to administrator messages, override method to be able to use put and remove method of frontend and passport form to users' navigations.
I have used MongoDB as the database, connecting it through Mongoose.
For styles I have used Bootstrap 4 and font-awesome
